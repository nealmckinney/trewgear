<p>RK is the Head Technician at Sherpa Adventure Gear; which means he?s the main authority on garment construction, pattern making, as well as overseeing the quality control for production. He has an uncanny knowledge for proper garment fit and construction that can only be the product of decades of experience and study. It?s really been a joy to work with him, and he embodies much of the sense of pride in workmanship and humble attitude that we?ve come to appreciate with working in Kathmandu. Not to mention that he has the looks of a Bollywood movie star. We interrupted his busy day in the sample room to joke around and ask a few questions (we told him it would only appear in US Weekly and Teen People, not to worry). </p>

CP: Typical. Favorite Music?<br />
RK: Classic Indi or Classic Nepali Music.<br />
CP: I?ll bet you?re a good dancer.<br />
RK: Scared smile (Joke lost in translation)<br />
CP: Ok, serious now. How long have you been working in garment manufacturing?<br />
RK: 29 years. But doing everything. Tailor, sampleman, supervisor, now head technician (garment guru).<br />
CP: What?s your favorite part about working on TREW Gear?<br />
RK: Lots of technical processes?it brings a lot of challenges and learning.<br />
CP: Which TREW Jkt would you wear?<br />
RK: Hmmm. (lots of thinking) Cosmic. Because the pockets are nice. Simple, clean. PowFunk has too much colors, crazy. </p>

<p>The first is the people. In our experience of manufacturing apparel in any country, quality and workmanship starts first with the people handling the machines and not the glamorous technology of the latest machines or the number of stories in a factory building. The human capital here in the small facility in Nepal is tremendous. We?re very fortunate to work with these many skilled tailors and sewers; and we look forward to sharing more images and profiles of these genuine people.</p>
<div id="attachment_1105" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://trewgear.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/MG_5683.jpg"><img src="http://trewgear.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/MG_5683-300x199.jpg" alt="" title="_MG_5683" width="300" height="199" class="size-medium wp-image-1105" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ram Kamur, Chief Technician, Garment Manufacturing Jedi</p></div>
<p>The other aspect of manufacturing here that I believe we benefit from is the context and culture of the Nepali people. There is a tradition of workmanship and quality in Nepal that is escalated, I think, by the harsh elements and geography that makes trade and transportation difficult and slow. In the high-alpine setting of the Himalayas, high-quality natural fibers like wool or waterproof, breathable synthetic laminates are cherished for their function and not their luxury. The other obvious cultural trait of the Sherpa people is their reverence and spiritual connection to the mountains. It would take a special type of callousness to wake up at 13,000 feet and watch the sunrise on the glowing Himalayan Mountains and not ignite some sense of spiritual wonder. This is something that all serious skiers and snowboarders can appreciate. JaH BleSS! </p>
