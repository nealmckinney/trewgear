		<h4>DELIVERY</h4>
		<p>We offer UPS Ground, UPS 2 Day, and UPS Overnight (next business day) shipping alternatives to customers.  Orders placed via Overnight before 1pm PDT should arrive by the end of the following business day.  We also offer standard International shipping to nearly any destination around the globe.</p>  

		<h4>FREE RETURNS & EXCHANGES</h4>
		<p>We are proud of the quality of our products, and hope that you will be delighted with your purchase.  If for any reason (or no reason at all) you are not fully satisfied, we are happy to accept returns and exchanges.  All orders include a pre-paid return label that can be used to send product back for a return or exchange.  In order for an item to be eligible for an exchange or refund, the product must be returned in its original condition (unworn, unwashed and with original tags attached).</p>

		<p>When sending an exchange or return, please make sure that you:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use the original packaging if possible.</li>
			<li>Include the packing slip and order confirmation (if possible) that accompanied your order.</li>
			<li>Include a brief note outlining the reason for a return, or for exchanges, clear instructions regarding the item, size, and color you wish to receive.</li>  
			<li>Slap the shipping label included in your original shipment on the box and we'll get it in a few days!</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@trewgear.com">mailto:info@trewgear.com</a> or call 541-251-6867 with any questions regarding an exchange or return request.</p>

		<p>All returns will be credited to the original form of payment.  Your account will be credited for the original amount paid.  For exchanges, you will be responsible for any difference in price between items returned and new items requested if the cost of the latter is greater.</p>  

		<p>This return and exchange policy only applies to items purchased at <a href="trewgear.com">trewgear.com</a>, at TREW events, via our phone number, or off our mobile RV store.  Returns and exchanges for items purchased through another vendor must be completed through that vendor.</p>
