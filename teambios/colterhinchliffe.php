    Hey I'm Colter! I'm from the mountains of Aspen, CO and I still spend most of my time there (best town in America). I also spend a lot of my time in Utah
    skiing POW at Alta by winter and climbing in Moab by spring/fall. The climbing in Aspen is also stellar in the summer, along with the nightly life,
    friends, biking, and swimming. Climbing is my second love. I'm proud to have been TREW since their start up year. We have had some wild times in HaRVey the
    RV, some of the best days of my life, nothin but Nifkins. Get some Bibs!

    Where in the world and with who, would be your ideal day of riding?
</div>
<div>
    • Honestly, Either lapping the Gondy on Ajax, or Collins and Wildcat at Alta with a solid 4 pack of good buddies, on a storm day. Not filming or doing
    anything but shredding the free refills as it duuuuumps and noone is there.
