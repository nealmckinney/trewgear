<p>I was brought up on skis... I remember my folks forcing me to ski on the most miserable days imaginable when I was a kid. It could have been -10 degrees with 40 mph winds or blue bird and beautiful it did not matter we were out there regardless. I will be sure to do the same with my children when that time comes. Seriously though skiing has been my driving force for longer than I can remember. The mountains, the people involved and the lifestyle in general has been the reason I get out of bed in the mornings. I love this sport and will always be a full fledged ski nerd.</p>

<p><b>Accomplishments</b></p>
<p>Have had some top 10 finishes in IFSA Freeskiing competitions notably Aspen Freeride Series 2005 and 2006, also Taos 2007. I have really cut back on the competition side of things over the last few years. I love the comps and the whole Freeskiing community and am a very competitive person, however it is difficult to go to all these sick venues and not get to explore due to the competition schedule. I plan on doing a bunch more photo and video work in the up coming seasons. There is nothing better than being out in the backcountry skiing and shooting with your closest friends.</p>
 
<p><b>Ideal Day on the Mountain</b></p>
<p>I could go with the cliche answer of 20 inches of fresh with untouched blower all day, natural features all over and hot chicks waiting for me in a hut tub with a case of PBR.  However, the reality is everyday on the mountain is ideal for me....  I just love being out there and skiing in every condition imaginable! Diversity is one of the sickest aspects of skiing. Even when I catch myself thinking shit it sucks today I still manage to have a great day.</p>
 
<p><b>Next Season</b></p>
<p>Lots of sled access skiing all around North America.  Also do a few IFSA Freeskiing tour stops hope to get some solid filming and generally be thankful that I get to do what I love and be immersed in this culture.</p>

<p><b>Anything Else?</b></p>
<p>I have a crazy story... When I was 15 years old I was shot in the back with a 22-gauge riffle. I know this sounds like it has the potential of being some badass story with gangs and car jackings, unfortunately it was strictly the product of stupidity. So here it goes... One of my friends in high school lived on a farm near Loveland Colorado where I grew up. His family raised horses at their property.  As a favor to his father we would periodically "exterminate" the prairie dogs so the horses would not step in one of their holes and break their legs. So on one of those very dangerous hunts I got shot. Luckily it was a old riffle that did not pack a very strong punch. The bullet hit me right above the hip, I did not even feel it until I looked down and saw my shoe covered in blood. At that point I yelled to my friend holy shit that prairie dog got all over me. I quickly realized that it was my blood.  After the panic died down I was able to remove the bullet with some "sterilized" pliers and patch myself up pretty good. Out of fear and embarrassment I choose to avoid a hospital visit. I lived and have a sweet scar to remind me why gun safety is important!!!</p>
