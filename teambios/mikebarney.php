<p>My name is Mike Barney and I live in Silverton, Co.  I spend most of my time skiing or thinking about skiing.  I have spent the last seven years in kind of a cycle.  I start by working all summer milling wood on my wood-mizer.  Then in the fall I shoot an elk and chop wood until it starts to snow.  Early winter I spend skiing the backcountry around Silverton, Co. Then around March I head up to Alaska where I work as a ski guide for Valdez Heli Camps.  In Alaska, I normally ski about 25 to 35 days out of the heli per season.  Out of those days about 10 of them are truly amazing--perfect snow, no wind, no weather, and a good group.  After a year of working to get ready for Alaska, I maybe get two perfect runs a season.   The kind of run that three years later I can still describe every turn and recall the thoughts that ran through my head before I dropped in. So what my season depends on are these runs, getting one or two amazing lines.  I started working for these runs along time ago and will happily work all summer in anticipation of next years.</p>
