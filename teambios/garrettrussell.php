    Hello world. Garrett Russell here. Originally from Telluride, CO thanking you for taking the time to read this and checking out the best outerwear in the
    Universe. I am a professional ski bum and love to travel, jump, float, submerge, shred, party, tour, hike, slide, and anything to do with snow or water. I
    spend my summers guiding/coaching other snow enthusiast in Argentina with my friends/family at SASS Global Travel (SGT). Let the snow fall forever and
    happiness is like a butterfly, the more you chase it the more it will elude you. But if you turn your attention away from it, it will come and softly land
    on your shoulder... Salud!
