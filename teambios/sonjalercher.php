    Hey my name is Sonja. I like to ski and explore mountains. Since 2007 I've been competing on Freeskiing World Tour, which has given me the opportunity to
    travel to many cool places, and push my limits in skiing. I'm into yoga, and kiting, and I also spend way too much money on tattoos. Another thing I'm
    stoked on is Stand Up Paddle Boarding. I teach it in Whistler during the summer, it's fun and keeps me in shape. Hoping to move into a big bus with my
    pooch soon, and travel to all the Freeskiing comps with my friends. I like to camp out down by the river, and spontaneously go wherever it snows. Skiing
    stays Trewly the ultimate goal.
