<p>My Life Story:</p>
<p>Once upon a time, a Princeness asked the beautiful Prince Rathod "Will you marry me?" "The Prince humbely responded, no." and lived happily ever after.  He traveled the world and skied the biggest mountains and climbed to the top of the highest mountains and rode Ducati's really fast and slept with lots of good looking women and shot shotguns and raced fast cars and and had a awesome 185lbs dog named Birbal and went to gentlemans clubs and dated women half his age and drank Jameson and Midleton and never heard any whining and never paid child support or alimony and danced till 3:01am every night and wore awesome suits and kept his house and guns and cars and motorcycles and never had to watch chick flicks or go to couples parties and all his friends and family thought he was super cool as hell and had tons of money in the bank and did what ever he wanted for ever and ever.  The End.</p>
