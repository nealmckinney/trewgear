<p>Hey what's up.  My name is Mattias and I like to ski da pow.  I choose to live in Squaw Valley, CA because of the amazing terrain to ski and have fun on in the summer.  Tahoe is definitely one of the raddest places on earth inhabited by the raddest people.  Other than that, I love that skiing brings you to new places all over the world.  Whether it's seeking new terrain or the endless search for that next powder turn, skiing is a sport of possibilities and endless exploration. That in itself is motivation to ski forever.  And do it in style with Trew Gear baby!</p>
