<p>Hi. I’m 29. My home is Mt. Rainier National Park, Cascade Mountains, & Crystal Mountain, WA.  Big thanks to my sponsors: Spacecraft, Spark R&D, Petzl, Jetboil, Burton, Gallardo Surf. I’ve had the First documented snowboard descents in the Northwest; as well as snowboard descents on the 25 most prominent volcanoes in the US Cascades. My ideal day on the mounain… blue skies, bottomless powder, no avy danger... and no one else around. But I'll settle for perfect corn with good friends. Next Season I want to get into more technical approaches, and complete more classic ski mountaineering objectives that haven't had any snowboarders on them yet. Slowly, I'm trying to show that there are advantages to touring on a board. Other than just riding, avalanche education and awareness are super important to me, as is a safe transition from the slackcountry to the true backcountry for many snowboarders that are moving in that direction. Human-powered shredding can be really rewarding and I'd like to make that more possible for more people... but in a safe, sane way. Also…The Cascades Rule!</p>
