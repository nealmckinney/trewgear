<p>20<br>Park City Mountain Resort<br>Bluehouse Skis, 4bi9</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s the most fun sport in the world. I started skiing when I was about two years old. Then after more than a decade of mastering the pizza and french fries I started sliding rails and catching air!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Accomplishments</b></p>
<p>Featured in 4bi9 Media’s first two films, “Look it up” and “Slamina!”. Also check out this year’s movie, “So far so hood”! I also made finals in Level 1 Production’s Superunknown contest. I won a rail jam a couple years ago.</p>
 
<p><b>Ideal Day on the Mountain</b></p>
<p>The ideal day is probably in late February. I would wake up at 6:50 and have an email informing me that my 7:30 class has been cancelled. While I was asleep it will have snowed 30+ inches of light and fluffy. However, the snow stopped falling late last night and there was still time for the groomers to get the park in perfect shape. So basically I go ski powder from about 9-12:30, then go rip the park until the resort closes. After that I head home to have pasta for dinner and then go hit urban until 3:00 in the morning.</p>
 
<p><b>Next Season</b></p>
<p>I want to take a break from school and be able to travel a little bit. I had a couple really fun trips this season and want to do it again. I’ll be filming with 4bi9 a bunch next season and hopefully stop by at a few competitions along the way. I also plan on not getting injured if possible.</p>
  
<p><b>Other Interests</b></p>

<p><b>Anything Else?</b></p>
