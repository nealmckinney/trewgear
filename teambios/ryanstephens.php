<p>My name is Ryan Stephens and stoked to have my home mountain as Mount Hood!! I moved out west five years ago on a whim and with snowboarding being the best thing I had going for me at the time, it just made sense.  I enjoy the northwest the most because of snows ability to stick to features of mountains where in a lot of other snow climates it just wouldn’t be possible.  The snow also rides a lot like surfing, which is a huge influence in my snowboarding. My goals are simple: keep it safe and keep it fun! Gotta thank my two sponsors for having my back. This year I want to hit big jumps into good snow, and big lines with even better snow!!</p>
