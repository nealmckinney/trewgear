    Yo party people! Let me tell you a little about myself... I am proud to be born at Aspen Valley Hospital on August 28, 1983 into the raddest family ever-
    big ups to my folks Steve and Judi, and lil' sis' Carly! I am so stoked to be a product of the Elk Mountains, the Aspen Valley Ski Club, Aspen High, CU
    Boulder, and this "never-never land" called Assspen! I like to think of myself as a self-proclaimed soul skier, life-lover, mountain guru, apres
    coordinator, and professional ski bum! The way I see it--Peter Pan ain't got shit on me! I consider myself the luckiest kid in the world, and I look
    forward to spending my life in the mountains with my friends and family, chasing pow all over the planet, and livin it up before I'm gone.

    I'd like to thank all my family and friends who know me well and still like me- you guys are seriously the best. Also big ups to all my sponsors:
    Aspen/Snowmass, Smith Optics and Helmets, Blizzard Skis, and Tecnica for their unwavering support of this ski bum. I can't thank them enough, and living
    the dream wouldn't be possible without them! Much thanks to the countless people who helped me get a start in the biz, helped along the way, and offered
    all the advice over the years- you know who you are. And to my boys at TREW, I am so stoked to be a part of the family. You guys are killin it with your
    passion, dedication, and stellar product! Keep spreading the much needed TREWth to the world! To the future boys!!!
