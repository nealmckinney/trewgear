<p>I’m Max Mancini and I grew up skiing in Crested Butte, CO where I learned to Tele when I was 9.  Since, I have been working hard in the Telemark scene, and have been lucky enough to have appearances in 5 Warren Miller films, a National commercial spot for Nature Valley and segments in 16 other telemark films.  The past couple years my skiing has reached new, philanthropic levels. I co founded a non profit organization called Life Turns where we bring children living with traumatic medical conditions to Crested Butte, CO for a week of winter activities, team building exercises free of charge. <a href="www.lifeturns.org">(www.lifeturns.org)</a> I have also been given a pro model ski from Rossignol, “The System S7 Pro Mancini” which is the first ever tele pro model. I donated all of the royalties from the sales of this ski last season to The Children’s Hospital in Denver, and Rossignol matched my donation. Other than that I spend a lot of time working as little as possible, kayaking, mountain biking and pretending to be a photographer.</p>
