    What can we say about Adam Ü? During the winter the best place to find him is near Chair 5 at Mt. Baker, either skiing underneath it flying off of
    everything in sight or riding up it, yelling at you to stop sucking and do something cool. However, you’re also equally likely to find him on an expedition
    in some distant mountain range in some exotic country, poring over maps and pioneering first descents. During the summer there’s a good chance he’s doing
    his marine biologist thing on a boat in the middle of the ocean, pulling golf balls out of whales’ blowholes or shooting dolphins with crossbows in the
    name of science. He’s equally likely to blow out your eardrums with the latest Metalmücil hit or croon your pants off with the most organic acoustic ballad
    you’ve ever heard. Free heel or fixed heel, mountains or oceans, electric or acoustic, he’s got it covered.

    Any advice for our up and coming am team riders?
</div>
<div>
    • Do it because you love it – any other reason is the wrong reason. Spell check and proof read. Twitter/text-speak is not an acceptable way to communicate
    professionally.

    What keeps you TREW to riding?
</div>
<div>
    • It’s the best way to move in three dimensions because I can’t fly and I am a crappy surfer.
